            <h1>Understanding third conditional</h1>

            <h2>What is third Conditional for?</h2>

            <p>Third conditional is used to talk about a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation. For example: "If she had studied, she would have passed the exam."</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>

            <p>The 'if clause' will be in past perfect', and the 'main clause' will be would + have + past participle.
            </p>
            
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                <th>If clause</th>
                <td>If + subject + verb in the past perfect</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Main clause</th>
                    <td>subject + would + have + past participle</td>
                </tr>
                
            </table>
            
            <p>
                If the main clause comes before the If clause, the use of a comma will not be necessary.
            </p>
